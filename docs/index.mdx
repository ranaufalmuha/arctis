## What is Arctis UI?

**Arctis UI** is a free, open-source full UI kit built for modern web developers. It ships beautifully crafted components and motion-rich animations that you simply **copy, paste, and own** — no black-box packages, no version conflicts, no surprises.

Every component is hand-written with:

  <Card title="React & Next.js" icon="react">
    Components are built as standard React functional components, fully
    compatible with the Next.js App Router and `"use client"` directive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="TypeScript" icon="code">
    Fully typed out of the box. Prop interfaces are exported so you can extend
    and customize without guessing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tailwind CSS" icon="paintbrush">
    Styling is done entirely with Tailwind utility classes — no external CSS
    files to manage or override.
  </Card>
  <Card title="GSAP & Three.js" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Animation components are powered by GSAP for smooth 2D motion and Three.js
    for immersive 3D experiences.

## Why Copy-Paste?

Most UI libraries lock you into their design system. With Arctis UI, the code **lives in your project** the moment you paste it. That means:

- **Full ownership** — tweak anything, anytime, without fighting library internals
- **Zero runtime dependency** — no extra bundle weight from a library you don't fully use
- **Framework agnostic-friendly** — works anywhere React runs
- **Readable source** — every component is clean, commented, and meant to be understood
