## Prerequisites

Before using any Arctis UI component, make sure your project is set up with the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="React + Next.js">
    Arctis UI components are written for React 18+ and are fully compatible with the **Next.js App Router**.

    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeBlock filename="pnpm" language="bash" >
      pnpm create next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="npm" language="bash" >
      npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind
      </CodeBlock>
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Tailwind CSS">
    All components use Tailwind for styling. If you didn't set it up via the Next.js wizard, install it manually:

    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeBlock filename="pnpm" language="bash" >
      pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="npm" language="bash" >
      npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p
      </CodeBlock>
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="TypeScript">
    Arctis UI is written in TypeScript. It works with plain JavaScript too, but TypeScript is recommended for the best experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your First Component

Let's add the **Flair Cursor Follower** — a GSAP-powered cursor animation — to your project.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Some components require additional packages. Check the component page for its specific dependency.

    For the Flair Cursor Follower, install GSAP:

    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeBlock filename="pnpm" language="bash" >
      pnpm add gsap
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="npm" language="bash" >
      npm install gsap
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="yarn" language="bash" >
      yarn add gsap
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="bun" language="bash" >
      bun add gsap
      </CodeBlock>
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the component">
    Go to the component page, click the **Code** tab, and copy the full component source. Paste it into your project — for example at:

    ```
    src/components/ui/flair-cursor-follower.tsx
    ```

    <Note>
      Every Arctis UI component is self-contained. You own the file the moment you paste it.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import and use it">
    Add the component to any page or layout. For global cursor effects, place it in your root layout:

```tsx
import { FlairCursorFollower } from "@/components/ui/flair-cursor-follower";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <FlairCursorFollower />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your app">
    Start your dev server and move your cursor around — you should see the flair animation in action!

    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeBlock filename="pnpm" language="bash" >
      pnpm dev
      </CodeBlock>
      <CodeBlock filename="npm" language="bash"  >
      npm run dev
      </CodeBlock>
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Folder Structure (Recommended)

We recommend keeping Arctis UI components in a dedicated folder so they're easy to find and update:

```
src/
└── components/
    └── ui/               ← Arctis UI components live here
        ├── flair-cursor-follower.tsx
        ├── magnetic-button.tsx
        └── ...
```

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always check component dependencies">
    Each component page lists its required packages under the **Installation** tab. Some components need GSAP, some need Three.js, and some have zero external dependencies.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use 'use client' for animation components">
  All animation and interactive components require the `"use client"` directive
  at the top of the file since they use browser APIs like `window`,
  `addEventListener`, and refs. This is already included in every component —
  don't remove it.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Customize freely">
  Every component is designed to be modified. Colors, sizes, timing, easing —
  it's all just code in your project. No configuration files, no theme tokens to
  look up.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep the author header (please 🙏)">
    Each component file includes a small comment header crediting the author. You're not required to keep it, but it helps others trace where the component came from. It means a lot!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
